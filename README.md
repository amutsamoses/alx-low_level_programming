ALX-LOW_LEVEL_PROGRAMMING Hatching out


When practising low-level programming, the programmer must use techniques
vastly different from those employed in high-level programming languages.
During this course, we cover the crucial low-level C programming techniques
in Linux. Participants will learn both system functions, input/output capturing
and handling of files, pipes and sockets, as well as thread-aware programming
topics such as managing processes/threads, synchronization or inter-process
communication. We also cover the assembly language and hybrid programming.

0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

The typedef is a keyword that is used to provide existing data types with a new name. The C typedef keyword is used to redefine the name of already existing data types.

When names of datatypes become difficult to use in programs, typedef is used with user-defined datatypes, which behave similarly to defining an alias for commands.

The structure in C is a user-defined data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. The struct keyword is used to define the structure in the C programming language. The items in the structure are called its member and they can be of any valid data type.
